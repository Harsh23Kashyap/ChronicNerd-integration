DietNerd (https://dietnerd.org/) is a web-based LLM-powered tool that answers diet and nutrition-related questions by extracting and summarizing information from academic papers sourced from PubMed. Users can ask questions on various topics, including dietary strategies, nutrition science, and health outcomes, and receive detailed, evidence-based responses based on the latest research. It utilizes a unique article search strategy and is built with multiple safety-motivated touchpoints, including a safety analysis that evaluates the pros, cons, and risks of the topics in question.

The tool is designed to provide reliable and up-to-date information for individuals, health professionals, and researchers alike. Our mission is to enrich conversations between patients and their medical providers and equip users with knowledge.

## Clean local verification

The API tests use MySQL-specific transactions, foreign keys, and locking, so they should not be replaced with SQLite. A disposable MySQL 8 fixture is provided for a clean-clone run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
./tests/run_local_mysql_tests.sh
```

The script starts an isolated MySQL container, runs the API and concurrency integration tests plus the remaining test suite, and removes the database container and volume on exit. It uses port `33306` by default; set `CHRONICNERD_TEST_MYSQL_PORT` if that port is occupied.

For the browser fixture after the MySQL tests are green:

```bash
npm ci
# In separate terminals, with the same DB environment variables:
python tests/browser_test_server.py
python -m http.server 18080 --directory dietnerd-website
npm run test:browser
```

The browser fixture stubs only the external science APIs. A release claim still requires a separate live OpenAI/PubMed pass with valid credentials.
